# NEX
Non-uniform sampling EXchange format

The NEX project is an [NMRBox](https://www.nmrbox.org) initiative to engage the bioNMR community in creating a draft standard for the reporting of NMR sampling schedules.  This GitHub repository will be used to host the proposed data dictionary and example cases for the standard-in-development.  NEX is a STAR format and will therefore be compatible with NMR-STAR.  

Documentation of the data dictionary elements and general outline of the format will be preserved in the wiki portion of this repository.  Suggestions/feedback are welcome.
